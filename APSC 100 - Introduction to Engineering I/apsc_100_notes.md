# APSC 100

## M1-W2-V1: Introduction to Design

* Engineering Design Process
  * Important model through APSC 100 and 101
* Learning goals
  * List the stages in the design process from memory
  * Describe the general flow between stages in the design process, including the role of iteration
  * Explain why a formal design process is preferred to an unstructured approach
* Design
  * Common ideas that come to mind: creativity, invention, problem-solving, innovation
  * Design is a **process**
  * Engineering design is the process through which engineering knowledge and skills are applied to solve real-world, open-ended problems
    * Meaningful problems for society, planet, and humanity
    * Open-ended means that there is not a single solution
* Novice approach
  * Implement solution with trial and error
  * Focuses on one solution at a time
  * Cost inefficient
  * Not a good approach for an engineering team, especially for a larger project
* Engineering approach
  * Systematic process = better chance of success + on time + on budget
  * Stage 0: the problem
  * Stage 1: study and clarify the problem
  * Stage 2: generate potential solutions
  * Stage 3: identify most promising solution 
  * Stage 4: Develop and test solution 
  * Iteration: Review and revise solution 
  * Stage 5: Implement solution
  * Stages are not rigid checkpoints, and we will often revisit stages
  * The engineering design process is a guiding framework that increases chance of finding a solution
* Support for the Design Process
  * Costs: time, money, and resources
  * With the design process, fewer cost is spent on the early stages
  * Costs committed: early decisions determine spending for future stages

## M1-W2-V2: Stage 1: Study and Clarify the Problem

* Stage 1: who are the stakeholders and what are their needs?
* Learning goals
  * Explain who stakeholders are and why they are important
  * Describe what needs are and where they come from
* Stakeholder
  * Anyone who is influenced by the project or anyone who can influence the project
  * Example: stakeholders of a bridge
    * Designers, builders, users, government, maintainers, neighbors, municipalities, regulators, suppliers, shareholders, manufacturers, society
  * Stakeholders have varying degrees of influence, which may sometimes be unclear
  * To minimize risks and surprises, it is important to know and understand the issues and perspectives from all of the stakeholders, right from the beginning
  * Unlikely that we will be able to satisfy everybody
* Needs
  * Things that the final design must achieve to satisfy stakeholders
  * Stakeholder's wants or expectations of what the final design should be or do
  * Expressed Needs
  * Threshold needs (needs that might not be stated but would be obvious)
  * latent needs (needs that would not be stated but would be nice to have)
* Example: smartphone
  * Stakeholders: user and government regulators
  * User needs:
    * Is affordable
    * Has front and rear cameras
    * Warns of low battery
    * is waterproof
  * Regulator needs:
    * Complies with applicable wireless communication standrads
    * Complies with applicable safety standards for consumer electronic devices
  * Observations
    * Different stakeholders tend to have different needs
      * We should consider all stakeholders and have a good sense of stakeholder needs
    * Not all stakeholders think alike
      * Stakeholders from the same group may have differing or contradictory needs
    * Some needs might be expected without saying or so "obvious" that nobody thinks to mention them
      * Important not to miss obvious needs

## Learning-V3-Neuroscience

* Analogy: Olympic swimmer
  * They would not be cramming practice two days before the race
  * Thoughtfully arranged challenges going back for a long time
  * Learning is the same. Many students try to compress learning into cram sessions, which doesn't work
* Learning goals
  * Describe what happens in your brain when you learn, using the language of neuroscience
  * Explain why it is important to spread learning out over time, and why this is supported by neuroscience
  * Explain how neuroscience supports the deliberate practice approach to learning
* How the brain works
  * 100 billion neurons in the brain
  * Electrochemical signals are received by dendrites, cell body processes signals, signals travel to axon and are sent to other dendrites through axon terminals
  * A single neuron can have thousands of dendrites. The total number of connections is unimaginable
  * Neuroplasticity: neural connections can be changed and the brain can be reprogrammed
  * Effort and challenge batter: brain grows more connections, connections get stronger and more efficient for deeper and longer lasting learning
  * Knowledge is stored through the connections between neurons
  * A robust netowrk of neurons is better for recalling information
  * Unused neural connections weaken over time
  * Analogy: forest path
    * Paths will overgrow and disappear if we don't use it. Then we cannot retrieve information
    * Frequently traveling the path will make it larger
    * Multiple paths create a robust network
* Effective learning
  * More review is better
  * Quizzing (reviewing correct answers) gives the best results
  * Recap: using deep learning techniques that require retrieving and applying information is more effective than rereading and reviewing
* Why cramming doesn't work
  * Myelin: 20 percent of the brain. Coating on parts of the neurons
  * Myelin increases strength and speed of neural signals
  * Myelin makes recall quicker and more automatic
  * Myelin coating is developed over time, due to repeated activity of the neuron. Sleep plays a role in this process too
  * Developing myelin coating cannot be rushed, and learning cannot be rushed
* Effective learning based on understanding of myelin
  * Periods of high intensity learning
  * Breaks and time to relax
  * Repeated and more challenging practice
  * Full nights of sleep
* Effectiveness of deliberate practice
  * Challenge develops strong network
  * Focus: high intensity of learning for short period
  * Feedback corrects neural connections and helps long term retention
  * Refine: reflect over time

## M1-W3-V1: Stage 2: Generating Potential Solutions (Conceptualization)

* Learning goals
  * Describe the goals of the Generate Potential Solutions stage of the design process
  * List the guidelines for effective concept generation and explain why each is important
  * Describe the C-sketch process for concept generation
* Goal of stage 2:
  * Generate as many potential solutions to our design problem as possible
* Generating ideas
  * When generating ideas, as time goes on, we get more ideas with greater variety. This is the solution space. The more ideas, the better
  * We can't rely on first impressions for evaluating ideas
  * The more variety the better
  * Common mistakes
    * Stopping the solution generation too early
    * When to stop? depends on how good we feel the ideas are, and whether they have a good chance of solving the problem. How much time, how routine the problem is, how quickly we're coming up with new ideas
    * Didn't challenge ourselves with novel ideas. "Fixation" or "Anchoring". Getting stuck on one idea
* Solution generation guidelines
  * Generate as many unique ideas as possible
    * Focus on quantity not quality
    * Welcome creative, unusual, and "wild" ideas
  * Resist the temptation to start developing your first idea or favorite idea
    * Avoid fixation (anchoring)
  * Do not evaluate ideas yet - that will come later
    * Focus on what will make ideas work
  * Generate a variety of ideas
    * Work independently and in a team
    * Sketch, discuss, tinker
* C-Sketch
  * Collaborative sketching
  * The team gathers, each person with their own paper
  * Team clarifies the problem
  * Each person sketches a solution. No talking, no writing or words, not about creating works of art
  * Everyone passes their sketch to the person next to them (after ~3 minutes). And then they modify the sketch (add or erase)
  * Process continues until everyone has seen and contributed to every sketch
  * Benefit: everyone gets equal time and input to each idea (as opposed to traditional brainstorming)
  * The team reviews and discusses the collaborative sketches. Can engage in another round (challenge each other to come up with completely different ideas)

## M1-W3-V2: Stage 3: Identifying Most Promising Solution

* Learning goals
  * Describe the goals and steps in Stage 3 of the design process
  * Define screening, ranking, and scoring, and explain how they are used in this stage of the process
  * Describe how requirements and evaluation criteria from the target design specifications in Stage 1 are used in Stage 3
* Goal of stage 3:
  * Narrow down all possible solutions to our design problem, and identify the solution to be developed
  * After solution generation, all ideas could be the winner
  * Objective and systematic process of identifying best idea
* Requirements: the limits of acceptability for a design (from back in stage 1)
  * Screening: solutions that don't meet requirements should be removed immediately
* Evaluation criteria: measures that distinguish between levels of performance or stakeholder satisfaction (i.e. lower price is better)
  * Ranking: sort remaining potential solutions by approximate highest to lowest performance
    * Quick process
  * Scoring: for ideas that have potential, analyze
    * Build prototypes, run detailed analyses
    * Too many ideas is too much work, but we can't have too few ideas either
    * Can use tools such as WDM
  * Selection: select the best idea
* Summary
  * Screening
    * Compare to requirements and eliminate ideas that cannot meet requirements
  * Ranking
    * Roughly rank from strong to weak. Look for consistently strong ideas
  * Scoring
    * Quantify relative performance. Tool coming in Module 2 (WDM)
* Methods for ranking
  * Individual voting
    * Only works if everyone has a good understanding of problem, concepts, and evaluation criteria
    * Each person gets x number of votes for all concepts
    * Team totals vote
  * Borda count
    * Ranking top x out of y
    * Top z advance
  * Pairwise comparison
    * Comparing each concept against each other concept
    * Top x advance
  * Criterion-based ranking
    * Ranking based on performance of each concept in each criterion
    * Top x advance
* Iterative
  * We if we feel that we need to rerank ideas, we can come back to this stage

## M3-W9-V3: Stress and Strength

* Learning goals
  * Define stress, strength, elastic deformation, plastic deformation
  * Describe the difference between ultimate tensile strength and yield strength
  * Calculate stress for a simple component loaded in tension
  * Explain how to avoid yield and breaking failures for simple engineering components
* Stress
  * sigma = stress = Force/Area. Also called pressure in some contexts
  * Unit N/m^2 = Pa
* Fracture (breaking) failure
  * Cause
    * Stress > strength
    * sigma > sigma_ut (ultimate tensile strength of material)
  * To avoid:
    * Ensure sigma <= sigma_ut
    * Smaller force, thicker cable, or material with higher ultimate tensile strength
* Yield failure
  * Elastic deformation
    * Temporary change in shape
  * Plastic deformation (yield)
    * Permanent change in shape
  * Cause
    * Stress > yield strength
    * sigma > sigma_y (yield strength of material). Note that yield strength is less than ultimate tensile strength
  * To avoid:
    * Ensure sigma <= sigma_y
    * Smaller force, thicker cable, or material with higher yield strength

* Narrower part will have higher stress for same load. Keep this in consideration for Module 3

    * Waterjet cutter, laser cutter, 3D-printer
* Iterating in design: sketch -> CAD model -> rapid prototype
  * Quickly moving from virtual to physical models
* Rapid prototype vs conventional machining
  * Rapid prototyping: less time consuming, does not require manual labor and skill for operating machine
* Waterjet cutter
  * Capable of cutting through almost anything using high pressure water that acts like liquid sandpaper
    * Can cut through metal, glass, ceramics, concrete, plastics, wood, composites
  * Uses either high pressure water or water + abrasive
  * Downside
    * For most waterjets, the nozzle is vertical, so it can only be used for cutting flat, 2D shapes
      * It is possible to build up complex shapes from a series of 2D parts
      * Some sophisticated waterjets can change angle of nozzle, to cut slanted
    * Impossible to control the depth of cutting (cuts right through)
    * Materials will get wet
* Laser cutter
  * Laser follows cutting path determined by computer
  * Cut with accuracy. The type of material it can cut depends on the laser cutter
  * Power can be adjusted for moderate control over cutting depth
  * Limitations
    * Most laser cutters can only cut 2D shapes
    * Some materials may release harmful gases when cut
* 3D printer/Additive Manufacturing
  * Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM)
    * Plastic is melted and deposited strip by strip
  * Selective Laser Sintering (SLS)
    * Uses lasers to fuse powered material into solid form
    * Powder moves to work area, and laser adds a thin layer to the existing shape
    * Tends to produce better results than FDM
    * No need of support structures
  * Advantages
    * Make complex, fully 3D models
    * Take CAD files and great models
  * Limitations
    * Slow machines
    * Materials are limited
