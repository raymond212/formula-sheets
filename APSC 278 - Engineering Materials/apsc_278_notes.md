## Elastic and Plastic Properties

* <u>Elastic deformation</u>: non-permanent and reversible deformation

* <u>Young's modulus</u>: stiffness of a material

    * $\sigma=E\varepsilon$

    * $\sigma=\sigma_{eng}=\dfrac{F}{A_o}$

    * $\varepsilon=\varepsilon_{eng}=\dfrac{\Delta L}{L_o}$

    * Within the same class of materials, higher $E$ means higher melting point

* <u>Modulus of resilience</u>: energy absorbed during elastic deformation - area under stress-strain curve

    * $\mathrm{MOR}=\dfrac{\sigma_y^2}{2E}$

* <u>Poisson's ratio</u>: applicable for isotropic materials

    * $\nu=-\dfrac{\varepsilon_x}{\varepsilon_z}=-\dfrac{\varepsilon_y}{\varepsilon_z}$

* <u>Bond length</u>: $r_o$ is the interatomic distance that minimizes potential energy

â€‹	$E\propto\left(\dfrac{dF}{dr}\right)_{r_o}$

* <u>Yield strength:</u> $\sigma_y$

* <u>Ultimate tensile strength:</u> $\sigma_{UTS}$

* <u>Fracture (tensile) strength:</u> $\sigma_f$

* <u>Ductility:</u> amount of deformation before failure (% elongation or % area reduction)

* <u>Toughness:</u> energy absorbed before failure

* <u>Hardness:</u> resistance to localized plastic deformation

## 9. Crystal Strengthening

1. Grain size reduction - smaller grain size means more area at grain boundaries, which impede dislocation motion

    * Hall-Petch equation: $\sigma_y=\sigma_o+k_y d^{-1/2}$

2. Solid-Solution - substitutional and interstitial atoms cause stresses in lattice, which impede dislocation motion

3. Work hardening - plastic deformation (work hardening) strengthens metals by <u>increasing dislocation density</u> and <u>dislocation-dislocation interaction</u>, which impedes dislocation motion

    * $\sigma_T=K\varepsilon_T^n$

    * $\%CW=\frac{A_o-A_d}{A_o}\cdot 100$

## 10. Recrystallization and Grain Growth

* Homologous temperature: $T_H=\frac{T_{\text{deformation}}}{T_{\text{melting point}}}$ (in Kelvin) 

    * Pure metals: $T_H<0.4$ cold work, $T_H>0.4$ hot work

    * Alloys: $T_H<0.6$ cold work, $T_H>0.6$ hot work

* Rolling (work hardening) increases strength but decreases ductility. Grains are elongated

* <u>Annealing:</u> reverse effects of work hardening by releasing energy stored during work hardening, which drives recovery and recrystallization

    * Results in smaller grains

1. <u>Recovery</u>

    * Restoration of electrical and thermal properties. Dislocations reconfigure to have lower strain energy

2. <u>Recrystallization</u>

    * New strain-free equiaxed grains with low dislocation densities are formed

    * <u>Recrystallization temperature:</u> temperature at which recrystallization completes in one hour

    * Recrystallization temperature decreases with increased cold work

    * With more cold work, activation energy $Q$ decreases so the rate of recrystallization at a given temperature increases

    * Recrystallization occurs more rapidly in pure metals than alloys because solute atoms reduce mobility of grain boundaries

3. <u>Grain growth</u>

    * Grains grow to reduce grain boundaries and energy within material

    * $d^n-d_0^n=Kt$

## 11. Fracture

Ductile versus brittle fracture

* fracture toughness $K_c$: material's resistance to brittle fracture under presence of crack. Describes stress situation around crack tip

* $K_t$: stress concentration factor

Griffith equation: calculates critical stress for crack propagation

## 12. Fatigue

Fatigue failure requires tensile stresses 

* <u>Shot-Peening:</u> stores residual compressive stresses

* <u>Case-Hardening:</u> carbon or nitrogen rich surface created through atomic diffusion

S-N curve: relates fatigue strength and fatigue life (number of cycles until failure)

## 13. Ductile-Brittle Transition

* Drastic reduction in ductility as temperature is decreased

    * Ductile failure: due to dislocation movement

    * Brittle failure: due to cracks

* Higher strain rate increases the DBT temperature

* Higher carbon % of steel increases DBT temperature 

<u>Charpy impact test</u>

* Simulates severe conditions. Difference in potential energy is the absorbed energy

## 14. Creep Failure

* Time dependent permanent deformation of materials subjected a constant load at elevated temperatures

* Occurs at above $0.4 T_m$ for metals

1. <u>Primary creep:</u> due to work hardening

2. <u>Secondary creep:</u> constant creep rate due to balancing of work hardening and recovery. 90% of creep time 

3. <u>Tertiary creep:</u> acceleration of creep until rupture

* Higher temperature and higher stress increase creep rate

* Creep resistant: high melting temperature, high elastic modulus, and large grain size

* <u>Larson-Miller parameter:</u> relates temperature and time to rupture 

## 15. Corrosion

* Corrosion: chemical attack, resulting in oxidation (loss of electrons)

    * Driving force is reduction of energy

* Ingredients

    * Reduction in energy

    * Water or moisture to act as medium for ion conduction and ionic transport

    * Source of oxidant (normally O2, sometimes sulfur)

    * Mass transport of oxidant to the metal

* <u>Stress corrosion:</u> occurs at regions of high stress

* <u>Galvanic corrosion:</u> 

    * More reactive metal (anode) is oxidized - it corrodes

    * Less reactive metal (cathode) is reduced - it is protected

    * Galvanic series: ranks reactivity of metals and alloys in seawater at $25^\circ \text{C}$ 

    * EMF series: pure metals 

* Corrosion protection

    * Protective oxide - impedes oxygen transfer to metal interior. For example, chromium forms an oxide layer

    * Physical barriers - uses less chemically active metal layer, which inhibits contact with water and oxygen. For example, nickel, tin, chromium

    * Sacrificial (cathodic) protection - uses more chemically active metal layer, which corrodes while main metal stays intact

## 16. Phase Diagrams

* <u>Phase:</u> homogeneous portion of system that has uniform physical and chemical characteristics

    * Equilibrium conditions

<u>Binary Isomorphous Systems:</u> two elements, liquid and solid regions each contain one phase

* Liquidus line: boundary between all liquid and liquid/solid two phase region

* Solidus line: boundary between all solid and liquid/solid two phase region

* <u>Phase composition:</u> use tie line intersection with liquidus and solidus to find composition of liquid and solid phases

* <u>Lever rule:</u> gives mass fraction of liquid and $\alpha$-solid. Assumes infinite diffusion, so mass is distributed instantaneously

* <u>Non-equilibrium cooling:</u> cored structures, where center of solid particles have higher concentration

## 17. Phase Diagrams II

<u>Binary Eutectic Systems:</u> two elements, and there is a single chemical composition that solidifies at a lower temperature than any of its constituents

* Cooling at eutectic temperature: <u>lamellae</u> (alternating layers) of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ form

* If cooling crosses eutectic isotherm, then lamellae will form, in addition to primary regions. There will be primary $\alpha$, eutectic $\alpha$, and $\beta$
