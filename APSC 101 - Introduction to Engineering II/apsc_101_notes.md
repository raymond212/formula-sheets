* Hand tools
  * Aviation Snips or Shears
    * Two types that are mirror images

* Risk Categories

![risk](images/risk.png)

* Risk classification
  * Risk source vs risk category

* Risk management strategies
  * Avoid (best but often unable)
  * Mitigate (minimize likelihood or severity)
  * Transfer (pass risk to others, i.e. insurance)
  * Accept to live with consequences

* Safety is **paramount** 
* Risk matrix
  * Severity (1 to 5) and likelihood (1 to 5). Risk is the product (from 1 to 25)
* Procedure: Identify risk -> risk analysis -> is risk acceptable? (risk matrix). Either accept, avoid/transfer, or mitigate

* Learning Goals
  * Describe the different stages of typical team development (Tuckman model)
  * Identify key features of effective engineering teams
  * Describe the benefits and costs of conflict on a team
  * Identify appropriate conflict management strategies to use in various team situations

* Tuckman's Stages of Team Development
  * Completion of tasks vs team relationships
  * Forming: politeness, uncertainty, optimism. Lack of clear goals, people try to help. Team members work as individuals
  * Storming: members feel more willing to speak. Leads to conflict, tension, stress. Quality and quantity of work diminishes 
  * Norming: consensus built, roles established, standards set
    * Updated model: good and bad norming. Bad norming is where bad norms like skipping meetings comes to be accepted
  * Performing: successful performance, openness, trust established
* Transition between stages
  * Conflict: always present, but is out in the open and more intense during storming
  * Forming -> storming: time spent building team relations, leadership established
  * Storming -> norming: open communication, desire to get better as a team
  * Norming -> performing: environment where people feel safe to speak their minds. Value on the team over the individual
* Norms
  * Bad team norm if a teammate doesn't show up and that is just accepted
* Conflict management styles
  * Assertiveness (achieving own needs) and cooperativeness (achieve other's needs)

![conflict](images/conflict.png)

* Suited to different situations

## Van Anda Interview notes

* 2015: small community Van Anda
* First year that they've worried about it
* Climate change
  * Flooding (has not happened in 50+ years)
  * Drought (3 months of no rainfall)
    * Lake gone down 5 feet (evaporation)
* Dry summers, lake level dropped
  * Always had enough water
  * Now: making community aware of water usage
* Water
  * Ferries from Vancouver, or flown in (for high cost)
* No alternate source 
  * If the lake is compromised, no options
  * Plan B: trucking in water, not much of a plan
* Lack of alternate source
  * Only piped to one lake
  * Limited number of lakes
* Chlorine
  * $16000 for chlorine
  * Would be best if there was another way not using chlorine
* More willingness to talk about water
* Difficult to talk to representatives of industry
  * Notion that: industry is more important than environment
* Front end load
  * Expensive upfront, minimal cost later on
  * Bad to hit with costs constantly 
* Water
  * Drinkable
  * Simple, easy to run
* Putting in a well
  * Because of old mine shafts, not clean water
  * There's cost too (100k to just explore for water)
* Catch water
  * Not enough
* Small systems tend to not be engineered properly
* If money is spent, we want a good system that will last
* Some people are living off the grid, a system that needs power would be an issue to some people

  * Sometimes it is too cold/hot for operating the play pump
  * The tech is difficult to maintain by locals
  * Grown women end up using the play pump, which is not appropriately sized for the actual users
  * Lack of consultation with communities and users
